# Basic Python Chat Application

This is a simple chat application implemented in Python using sockets. The application allows users to connect to a server, chat with other connected users, and perform various actions such as changing their status and initiating peer-to-peer chats.

## Features

- **Server-Client Communication:** The application uses TCP sockets for communication between the server and clients, enabling reliable data transmission.
- **Peer-to-Peer Chat:** Users can initiate peer-to-peer chats with other connected users, facilitating direct communication without involving the server.
- **Status Management:** Users can change their status (online/offline) and view the online status of other connected users.
- **Threading:** The server utilizes threading to handle multiple client connections concurrently, allowing for efficient communication with multiple clients simultaneously.

## Installation

To run this project, first install python. 

## Usage

To use this application, make sure to run python server.py before running the client. The server has to be live in order for the client to connect to it.
